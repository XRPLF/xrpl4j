# In order to enable an amendment which by default would vote "No", you must include its amendment id and name here.
# To add amendments specifically from the latest releases of rippled:
# 1. Go to https://xrpl.org/known-amendments.html
# 2. Find the first amendment in the latest releases of rippled which are not already in the list below
# 3. Click on each amendment to get their Amendment ID and name to add to this list manually.
#    You will likely update the list with all amendments from a new release of rippled all at once.

# To get the list of amendments on a network (e.g. devnet) follow the steps in xrpl.js's CONTRIBUTING.md for "Updating the Docker container".
# https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl.js/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md
# (Running the script `getNewAmendments.js` should help you identify any new amendments that should be added.)
#
# Note: The version of rippled you use this config with must have an implementation for the amendments you attempt to enable or it will crash.
# If you need the version of rippled to be more up to date, you may need to make a comment on this repo: https://github.com/WietseWind/docker-rippled
