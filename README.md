[![javadoc](https://javadoc.io/badge2/org.xrpl/xrpl4j-parent/javadoc.svg?color=blue)](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.xrpl/xrpl4j-parent)

This project is a pure Java implementation of an SDK that works with the XRP Ledger. This library supports XRPL key 
and address generation, transaction serialization and signing, provides useful Java bindings for XRP Ledger objects and 
`rippled` request/response objects, and also provides a JSON-RPC client for interacting with XRPL nodes.

## Documentation

- [Get Started Using Java](https://xrpl.org/get-started-using-java.html): a tutorial for building a very simple XRP
  Ledger-connected app.
- Example usage can be found in the `xrpl4j-integration-tests`
  module [here](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl4j/tree/main/xrpl4j-integration-tests/src/test/java/org/xrpl/xrpl4j/tests).

## Usage 

### Requirements

- JDK 1.8 or higher
- A Java project manager such as Maven or Gradle

### Maven Installation

You can use one or more xrpl4j modules in your Maven project by using the
current [BOM](https://howtodoinjava.com/maven/maven-bom-bill-of-materials-dependency/) like this:

```
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.xrpl</groupId>
            <artifactId>xrpl4j-bom</artifactId>
            <version>4.0.5</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

Then you can add one or both of the `xrpl4j-core` and `xrpl4j-client` modules
found in the BOM to your `pom.xml`. For example:

```
<dependencies>  
  ...
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.xrpl</groupId>
    <artifactId>xrpl4j-core</artifactId>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.xrpl</groupId>
    <artifactId>xrpl4j-client</artifactId>
  </dependency>
  ...
</dependencies>
```

### Core Objects

This library provides Java objects modeling [XRP Ledger Objects](https://xrpl.org/ledger-data-formats.html),
[Transactions](https://xrpl.org/transaction-formats.html),
and [request parameters](https://xrpl.org/request-formatting.html)/[response results](https://xrpl.org/response-formatting.html)
for the [rippled API](https://xrpl.org/public-rippled-methods.html).

The objects in this module are annotated with `@Value.Immutable` from
the [immutables library](https://immutables.github.io/), which generates immutable implementations with builders, copy
constructors, and other useful boilerplate code.

For example, the following code constructs an `EscrowCreate` object, which represents
an [EscrowCreate](https://xrpl.org/escrowcreate.html) Transaction:

```java
EscrowCreate escrowCreate = EscrowCreate.builder()
  .account(Address.of("rf1BiGeXwwQoi8Z2ueFYTEXSwuJYfV2Jpn"))
  .fee(XrpCurrencyAmount.ofDrops(12))
  .sequence(UnsignedInteger.ONE)
  .amount(XrpCurrencyAmount.ofDrops(10000))
  .destination(Address.of("rsA2LpzuawewSBQXkiju3YQTMzW13pAAdW"))
  .destinationTag(UnsignedInteger.valueOf(23480))
  .cancelAfter(UnsignedLong.valueOf(533257958))
  .finishAfter(UnsignedLong.valueOf(533171558))
  .condition(CryptoConditionReader.readCondition(
  BaseEncoding.base16()
    .decode("A0258020E3B0C44298FC1C149AFBF4C8996FB92427AE41E4649B934CA495991B7852B855810100"))
  )
  .sourceTag(UnsignedInteger.valueOf(11747))
  .build();
```

These objects can be serialized to, and deserialized from, `rippled` JSON representations using the provided
Jackson `ObjectMapper`, which can be instantiated
using [`ObjectMapperFactory`](./xrpl4j-core/src/main/java/org/xrpl/xrpl4j/model/jackson/ObjectMapperFactory.java).

Using the `EscrowCreate` object created above, it is then possible to use the supplied `ObjectMapper` to serialize to
JSON like this:

```java
  ObjectMapper objectMapper = ObjectMapperFactory.create();
  String json = objectMapper.writerWithDefaultPrettyPrinter().writeValueAsString(escrowCreate);
  System.out.println(json);
```

Which produces the following output:

```
{
  "Account" : "rf1BiGeXwwQoi8Z2ueFYTEXSwuJYfV2Jpn",
  "Fee" : "12",
  "Sequence" : 1,
  "SourceTag" : 11747,
  "Flags" : 2147483648,
  "Amount" : "10000",
  "Destination" : "rsA2LpzuawewSBQXkiju3YQTMzW13pAAdW",
  "DestinationTag" : 23480,
  "CancelAfter" : 533257958,
  "FinishAfter" : 533171558,
  "Condition" : "A0258020E3B0C44298FC1C149AFBF4C8996FB92427AE41E4649B934CA495991B7852B855810100",
  "TransactionType" : "EscrowCreate"
}
```

### Public/Private Key Material

Most operations using this library require some sort of private key material. Broadly speaking, the library supports
two mechanisms: (1) in-memory private keys, and (2) in-memory _references_ to private keys where the actual private key 
material lives in an external system (e.g., keys in a Hardware Security Module, or HSM). In Java, this is modeled 
using the `PrivateKeyable` interface, which has two subclasses: `PrivateKey` and `PrivateKeyReference`.

#### In-Memory Private Keys (`PrivateKey`)

`PrivateKey` represents a private key held in memory, existing in the same JVM that is executing xrpl4j code. This key 
variant can be useful in the context of an android or native application, but is likely not suitable for server-side 
application because private key material is held in-memory (for these scenarios, consider using a remote service like 
an HSM).

For use-cases that require private keys to exist inside the running JVM, the following examples shows how to
generate a keypair, and also how to derive an XRPL address from there:

```java
import org.xrpl.xrpl4j.crypto.keys.KeyPair;
import org.xrpl.xrpl4j.crypto.keys.PrivateKey;
import org.xrpl.xrpl4j.crypto.keys.PublicKey;
import org.xrpl.xrpl4j.crypto.keys.Seed;
import org.xrpl.xrpl4j.model.transactions.Address;

Seed seed = Seed.ed25519Seed(); // <-- Generates a random seed.
KeyPair keyPair = seed.deriveKeyPair(); // <-- Derive a KeyPair from the seed.
PrivateKey privateKey = keyPair.privateKey(); // <-- Derive a privateKey from the KeyPair.
PublicKey publicKey = keyPair.publicKey(); // <-- Derive a publicKey from the KeyPair.
Address address = publicKey.deriveAddress(); // <-- Derive an address from the publicKey
```

#### Private Key References (`PrivateKeyReference`)

For applications with higher-security requirements, private-key material can be stored outside the JVM 
using an external system that can simultaneously manage the key material and also perform critical signing operations 
without exposing key material to the outside world (e.g., an HSM or cloud service provider). For these scenarios, 
`PrivateKeyReference` can be used.

This library does not provide an implementation that interacts with any particular external signing service or HSM.
However, developers wishing to support such interactions should extend `PrivateKeyReference` for the particular external service, and implement
[SignatureService](./xrpl4j-core/src/main/java/org/xrpl/xrpl4j/model/crypto/signing/SignatureService.java) for their `PrivateKeyReference` type.
interface. In
addition, [FauxGcpKmsSignatureServiceTest](./xrpl4j-core/src/test/java/org/xrpl/xrpl4j/crypto/signing/faux/FauxGcpKmsSignatureServiceTest.java)
and [FauxAwsKmsSignatureServiceTest](./xrpl4j-core/src/test/java/org/xrpl/xrpl4j/crypto/signing/faux/FauxAwsKmsSignatureServiceTest.java)
illustrate faux variants of a simulated external key provider that can also be used for further guidance.

### Signing and Verifying Transactions

The main interface used to sign and verify transactions
is [SignatureService](./xrpl4j-core/src/main/java/org/xrpl/xrpl4j/model/crypto/signing/SignatureService.java),
which has two concrete implementations: `BcSignatureService` and `BcDerivedKeySignatureService`. The first uses
in-memory private key material to perform signing and validation operations, while the latter can be used to derive
multiple private keys using a single entropy source combined with differing unique key identifiers (e.g., User Ids).

#### Construct and Sign an XRP Payment:

The following example illustrates how to construct a payment transaction, sign it using an in-memory private key, and
then submit that transaction to the XRP Ledger for processing and validation:

```java
import org.xrpl.xrpl4j.client.XrplClient;
import org.xrpl.xrpl4j.crypto.keys.PrivateKey;
import org.xrpl.xrpl4j.crypto.keys.Seed;
import org.xrpl.xrpl4j.crypto.signing.SignatureService;
import org.xrpl.xrpl4j.crypto.signing.SingleSignedTransaction;
import org.xrpl.xrpl4j.model.client.transactions.SubmitResult;
import org.xrpl.xrpl4j.model.transactions.Address;

import org.xrpl.xrpl4j.crypto.signing.bc.BcSignatureService;
import org.xrpl.xrpl4j.model.transactions.Payment;

// Construct a SignatureService that uses in-memory Keys (see SignatureService.java for alternatives).
SignatureService signatureService = new BcSignatureService();

// Sender (using ed25519 key)
Seed seed = Seed.ed25519Seed(); // <-- Generates a random seed.
PrivateKey senderPrivateKey = seed.deriveKeyPair().privateKey();
  
// Receiver (using secp256k1 key)
Address receiverAddress = Address.of("r9cZA1mLK5R5Am25ArfXFmqgNwjZgnfk59");

// Construct a Payment
Payment payment = ...; // See V3 ITs for examples.

SingleSignedTransaction<Payment> signedTransaction = signatureService.sign(sourcePrivateKey,payment);
SubmitResult<Payment> result = xrplClient.submit(signedTransaction);
assert result.engineResult().equals("tesSUCCESS");
```

### Codecs
This library relies upon two important sub-modules called Codecs (One for the XRPL binary encoding, and one for XRPL 
canonical JSON encoding). Read more about each here:

- [Binary Codec](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl4j/tree/main/xrpl4j-core/src/main/java/org/xrpl/xrpl4j/codec/binary/README.md)
- [Address Codec](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl4j/tree/main/xrpl4j-core/src/main/java/org/xrpl/xrpl4j/codec/addresses/README.md)

## Development

### Project Structure

Xrpl4j is structured as a Maven multi-module project, with the following modules:

- **xrpl4j-core**: [![javadoc](https://javadoc.io/badge2/org.xrpl/xrpl4j-core/javadoc.svg?color=blue)](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.xrpl/xrpl4j-core)
    - Provides core primitives like seeds, public/private keys definitions (supports secp256k1 and ed25519 key types 
      and signing algorithms), signature interfaces, address and binary codecs etc. Also provides Java objects which model XRP Ledger objects, 
      as well as request parameters and response results for the `rippled` websocket and JSON RPC APIs.
    - Provides a Jackson `ObjectMapper` with JSON bindings that serialize and deserialize to and from the JSON
      representation of XRPL Transactions; this is used to move to and from the canonical binary format of the XRP
      Ledger.
- **xrpl4j-client**: [![javadoc](https://javadoc.io/badge2/org.xrpl/xrpl4j-client/javadoc.svg?color=blue)](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.xrpl/xrpl4j-client)
    - Provides an example `rippled` JSON RPC client which can be used to communicate with a `rippled` node
- **xrpl4j-integration-tests**:
    - Contains the project's integration tests, which also serve as valuable xrpl4j usage examples for common XRPL
      flows.

You can build and test the entire project locally using maven from the command line:

```
mvn clean install
```

To build the project while skipping Integration tests, use the following command:

```
mvn clean install -DskipITs
```

To build the project while skipping Unit and Integration tests, use the following command:

```
mvn clean install -DskipITs -DskipTests
```
